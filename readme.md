# Description
Visualization of typical food items on a geographical map by web scraping wikipedia page of typical food and use it to display it on interactive map.

This is used for a personal challenge of cooking typical food from random countries around the world and it's available in [my personal blog](https://marcodallavecchia.github.io/biologistsadventure/eat-the-world/)
